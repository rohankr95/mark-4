<h1>What is Hypothesis Testing?</h1>

<p>
    We can interpret data by assuming a specific structure of our outcome and use statistical methods to confirm or reject the assumption. <br> 
    The assumption is called a hypothesis and the statistical tests used for this purpose are called statistical hypothesis tests. <br>

    <br>
    <br>

    Whenever we want to make claims about the distribution of data or whether one set of results are different from another set of results in applied machine learning,  <br>
    we must rely on statistical hypothesis tests. <br>

    <br>

    <br>

    Hypothesis testing is a statistical approach that is used with experimental data to make statistical decisions. <br>
     This is used to determine whether an experiment performed offers ample evidence to reject a proposal <br>
        <br>
     A Null Hypothesis implies that there is no strong difference in a given set of observations.

     <br>

     The basic assumption of a statistical test is called the null hypothesis, <br>
     and we can quantify and interpret statistical measurements to determine if the null hypothesis should be accepted or not. <br>

     We are interested to learn whether there is an actual or statistically meaningful <br>
     difference between the two models when choosing models based on their estimated skills. <br>

<h1>TERMINOLOGY</h1>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li> <span>Null Hypothesis:</span>  the hypothesis that sample observations result purely from chance. The null hypothesis tends to state that there’s no change.</li>
        <li><span>Alternative Hypothesis:</span> the hypothesis that sample observations are influenced by some non-random cause.</li>
        <li><span>P-value:</span> the probability of obtaining the observed results of a test, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct; a smaller p-value means that there is stronger evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.</li>
        <li><span>Alpha:</span> the significance level; the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true — also known as Type 1 error</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h1>Steps for Hypothesis Testing</h1>
<p>
    <ol>
        Here are the steps to performing a hypothesis test:
        <br>
        <br>
        <li> State your null and alternative hypotheses. *To reiterate, the null hypothesis typically states that everything is as normally was — that nothing has changed.*</li>
        <li>Set your significance level, the alpha. This is typically set at 5% but can be set at other levels depending on the situation and how severe it is to committing a type 1 and/or 2 error</li>
        <li>Collect sample data and calculate sample statistics.</li>
        <li>Calculate the p-value given sample statistics.</li>
        <li>Reject or do not reject the null hypothesis.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h1>Interpret Critical Value</h1>

<p>
    Some tests do not return a p-value.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead, they might return a list of critical values and their associated significance levels, as well as a test statistic. <br>
    These are usually nonparametric or distribution-free statistical hypothesis tests <br>

    The choice of returning a p-value or a list of critical values is really an implementation choice. <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    The results are interpreted in a similar way. <br>
    Instead of comparing a single p-value to a pre-specified significance level, <br>
    the test statistic is compared to the critical value at a chosen significance level. <br>
    <br>

    <ul>
        <li>If test statistic < critical value: Fail to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
        <li>If test statistic >= critical value: Reject the null hypothesis.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    Again, the meaning of the result is similar in that the chosen significance level is a <br>
    probabilistic decision on rejection or fail to reject the base <br>
    assumption of the test given the data. <br>
    <br>
    Results are presented in the same way as with a p-value, as either significance level or confidence level. <br>
    For example, if a normality test was calculated and the test statistic was compared to the critical value at the <br>
    5% significance level, results could be stated as: <br>

    <br>

    The test found that the data sample was normal, failing to reject the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level.

    <br>
     OR
     <br>
     The test found that the data sample was normal, failing to reject the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level.
