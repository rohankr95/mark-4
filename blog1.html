        <h2 style="color: blue;">Why i Choose Web Development over Ml/AI</h2>
    
    


    <h3 style="padding-top:5rem ;">My Ml/AI journey</h3>
    <p>
        I had some intrest in ML/AI from my college days and also had a semester subject on machine learning. 
        <br> But after my college got over i started preparing for GATE exam so lost touch with machine learing.
        <br> But after my Gate exam got over i again switched back to learning ML and was enjoying learning various beautiful algorithms like decision tree, NaiveBaiyes etc.
        <br> Then after few months i also started learning Deep learning. 
    </p>

    <h3>What happened next</h3>
    <p>
        After learning stuff of Ml/Ai/DL when i started applying for the Ml jobs i realised that every Jd of Ml/AI wanted 2-3 years of 
        <br> experience in the related field and those which was entry level where not paying more than what TCS Wipro pays.
    </p>

    <h3>How Twitter helped me</h3>
    <p>
        while scroling twitter field i came across tanay sir tweet on ML/AI hype and then did some 
        <br> research on the actual job opportunities in ML/AI and also watched Tanay sir video on ML/AI. 
        <br> I thought i messed it all up and then from there begins my journey of Web development with level-0.
