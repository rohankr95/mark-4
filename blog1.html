        <h1>What is coorelation and causation ?</h1>
    <p>
        Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates how two or more variables move together. <br>
        <br>

        - It is measured between 0 to 1. <br>
        <br>
        - Positive correlation → variables move in same direction. <br>
        <br>
        - Negative correlation → variables move in opposite direction. <br>
        <br>

        Causation indicates that one event directly causes another event to occur. (Causing something to happen).
    </p>

    <h1>What’s the Difference?</h1>

    <p>
        The major distinction is that just because two variables are correlated does not mean that one causes the other to happen
    </p>

        Here, chicken and moon are correlated but eating chicken does not ensure you will go to the moon hence this is not causation. <br>

        <br>

        Example: A child has started watching online videos in his mobile the whole day. <br>
        Now the internet bills has went high along with his grades going significant down. <br>

        <br>

        Watching online videos has caused high internet bills and low grades. So, it's causation. <br>
        <br>

        But high internet bills and low grades are negatively correlated but these events didn't cause each other's events to happen. <br>
        So, it's a correlation. <br>

        <br>

        When there is a common cause between two variables, then they will be correlated. <br>
        This is part of the reasoning behind the less-known phrase, “There is no correlation without causation". <br>

        <br>

        <br>


        The two variables may not be a direct cause of each of them, but it’s there somewhere “upstream” in the picture. <br>
         It turns out that if you don’t include hidden common causes in your model, <br>
          you’ll estimate causal effects incorrectly. <br>

          <br>
          <br>


          Simple examples: I should eat, because the causal effect of “eating” on “hunger” is negative. <br>
          I should show more impressions of this ad, because the causal effect of impressions on page views is positive. <br>
